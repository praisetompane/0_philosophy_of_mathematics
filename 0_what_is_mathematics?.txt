Mathematical Knowledge:ยน 
    properties:
        Certain: You know absolute certainty that 2+2=4
        Encouragle: It is not going to be corrected later by new knowledge
        Eternal: If something is true in Mathematics:
                    it is True now, 
                    it has always been True
                    it will always be True
        Necessarily True:
            2+3=5 it cannot equal anything, but 5. 

    why is Mathematical Knowledge this way?

why can't other knowledge have these properties?
