- Seem to be the CONTENT of OBJECTIVE TRUTHsÂ¹ 
    2+3=5 is not made up, not getting it from anyone etc it is OBJECTIVELY TRUE
    Most Objective Truths are about OBJECTS
        A lemon is yellow
        An apple is red

    Are numbers objects?
        We can't sense them(see, feel, taste, etc)
        Do not exist in Space and Time
            Does not corrode, get old, can't ask about its physical properties(size, colour etc)
        Does not reflect light

        Plato's Theory of Forms:
            attempts to define numbers as objects

            def numbers: are forms.
            def forms: are abstracl objectively existing objects.
            i.e. Numbers are NOT part of spatia-ltemporal world

            Reality is formal
                The world of forms is the reality
                    of which our spatial-temporal is a shadow
        
        Aristole
            mathematics is about our world

            def numbers: 
                are properties of the objects in our spatial-temporal world.
            
            objection: Frege
                objects DO NOT have numbers as properties
                    They acquire a Number based on how we perceive or are thinking about them
                        Example: Deck of cards
                            Has Number property 4, when thinking about Suits
                            Has Number property 52, when thinking about Deck Size

            conclusion: World of Forms considered REFUTED.
